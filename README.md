# bootstrap4-project

During my JAMstack bootcamp with the Coders Guild, I was challenged to create a website using Bootstrap.  

## Challenge Overview
The challenge is to design and develop a website using Bootstrap 4 as the primary front-end framework. Bootstrap 4 offers a wide range of responsive components and utilities that will help craft a professional-looking website that works seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
In this project, I utilised the following technologies:

- **HTML:** To create the structure and content for the website.

- **CSS:** To style the website.

- **Bootstrap 4:** Leverage the power of Bootstrap 4's components, grid system, and responsiveness

- **JavaScript:** To implement interactivity and dynamic behaviour to the website.

- **Git:** For version control, allowing for tracking changes.
